# This is a sample camera app built using Kotlin, Camera2 API

**Currently this has limited features**

**1. Open app and capture pics using both back and front camera.**

**2. Object detection feature which is powered by a very light -weight SSD MobileNet v1 model with labels of 90 objects supported on both front and rear camera**

**3. Supports 4 flash modes(On/off/auto/torch).**


**Tested on Samsung Galaxy S21**

Note: 
1. Pictures captured will be stored in DCIM folder(Will appear in gallery/photos). 
2. Flash auto is same as flash on for now.
3. Tap to focus needs to be optimized and correspond with sensor space
